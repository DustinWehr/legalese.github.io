	  <h1>TERMS OF USE</h1>
	  <p>Effective: 1 November 2017</p>
	  <p>Last modified:    25 October 2017 (view archived versions)</p>
	  
	  <h3>Hello!</h3>
	  <p>We are so chuffed to have you with us.</p>
	  <p>As you may already know or have gathered, our platform, website, services, community / developer resources, and products (“<b>Products</b>” are provided by Legalese Pte. Ltd. (“<b>Legalese</b>”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>our</b>” or “<b>us</b>”)  – an international, open source, remote-first, aspirationally <a class="a-link" href="http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Teal_Organizations">teal</a> and <a class="a-link" href="https://www.holacracy.org/how-it-works/">holacratic</a> company -- incorporated in Singapore with the unique entity number 201527692R.</p>
	  <h4>The extended team, but not family</h4>
	  <p>We may leverage our employees and contributors, and such of those of our corporate affiliates and third party contractors ("<b>Extended Team</b>") in exercising our rights and performing our obligations. We will be responsible for the Extended Team’s compliance with our obligations under these Terms of Use and if applicable, incorporating and including any additional agreement(s), terms, or requirements that you have with us (collectively, these “<b>Terms</b>”).
	  <p>We call them the Extended Team and not a “family” because we read <a class="a-link" href="https://hbr.org/2014/06/your-company-is-not-a-family">this</a>.</p>

	  <h3>First things first</h3>
	  <h4>These Terms form a part of a binding contract</h4>
	  <p>These Terms describe your rights and responsibilities, and governs your access and use of any or all of the Products, including any of the services or features offered through it.  We know it can be a bit of a chore (as these things usually are), but please do read them carefully as by using or accessing any of our Products, you are agreeing to these Terms.  In other words, if it wasn’t already clear before, these Terms form a binding agreement between you and Legalese.
	    We will post any changes via our Products so please revisit every so often because we will assume that you agree with them if you continue to use the Products. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our Products.</p>
	  <h4>Who ‘you’ are</h4>
	  <p>You are the individual using and/or accessing our Products.</p>
	  <p>However, if an individual signed up for an account using a corporate email domain (“<b>Individual</b>”), “<b>you</b>” means the entity owning that corporate email domain used to sign up for an account. This means that the entity – being ‘you’ under these Terms – is entitled to modify, re-assign roles, or otherwise exercise any of its rights under these Terms. If that entity so elects to replace the Individual as the representative with ultimate authority for the entity, we will provide the Individual with notice following such an election and the Individual agrees to take any action(s) reasonably requested by us or by that entity to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the entity.   You will also hold harmless and indemnify Legalese and the Extended Team, including each of Legalese’s and the Extended Team’s affiliates, officers, agents, contractors, and employees from any claim, suit, or action arising from or related to the use of the Products or violation of these Terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs, and attorneys’ fees.</p>
	  <h4>You are also agreeing to these Terms on behalf of whomever you are accessing our Products</h4>
	  <p>If you are purchasing or subscribing to any of our Products, are inviting someone to access the Products, or are allowing the use of the Products, <b>on behalf of a person</b> (whether an individual, company, organisation, or any kind of entity), you are also agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that person. As such, please make sure that you have the necessary authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of that person before proceeding.</p>

	  <h3>Using our Products</h3>
	  <h4>Follow our instructions as intended, and no misconduct or misuse please! </h4>
	  <p>You must ensure that you and anyone you give access to and/or authorise to use the Products in your account (“<b>Authorised Users</b>”) fully comply with these Terms. We may review conduct for compliance purposes, but we have no obligation to do so.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Our Products are not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of 18.</li>
	    <li>You and your Authorised Users must follow any policies made available to you within or via the Products.</li>
	    <li>You and your Authorised Users must not misuse our Products.<br><em>For example, you and your Authorised Users must not interfere with the Products (or our provision of them), and further must not try accessing them using a method other than via the interface and instructions that we provide. This includes any technological measures we employ to enforce these Terms.</em></li>
	    <li>You and your Authorised Users must not use our Products where it is prohibited by laws applicable (whether to you or us), including any export and re-export control laws and regulations that may apply.</li>
	    <li>You and your Authorised Users must not use the Products in a way that infringes anyone’s rights.</li>
	    <li>Using our Products does not give you or your Authorised Users any ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Products or any content or features accessed therein.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h4>User Data</h4>
	  <p>You or your Authorised Users may upload, submit, store, send or receive content or information (including any confidential company or personal data) as part of your use and/or access of our Products, (“<b>User Data</b>”) and you may exclusively provide us with instructions (at the time of disclosure) on what to do with it.<br><em>For example, you may provision or deprovision access to the Products, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention, and export settings, transfer or assign Authorised Users, share information with external parties, consolidate information, etc.</em><br>Since these choices and instructions of you and/or your Authorised Users may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification, or deletion of certain or all User Data, please consider your instructions carefully and be familiar with our <a class="a-link" href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
	  <p>It is your responsibility to (a) inform all Authorised Users of your own policies and practices, and applicable laws and/or regulations that are relevant to their use of the Products and of any settings and interaction that may impact the processing of User Data; and (b) obtain all rights, permissions, or consents from Authorised Users or such other persons that are necessary to grant the rights and licenses under these Terms and for the lawful use and transmission of user Data and the operation and use of the Products.</p>
	  <p>Your User Data is uploaded and downloaded over a secure connection, your credentials are encrypted and hashed. We don’t store (or even know) your password. Your User Data is stored securely, and only people you’ve assigned as members of your team can access your data, per the access permissions you assigned to your team members. We expect you to ensure that your team, particularly those you give Admin access to, have strong passwords, ideally different to their social network site logins.</p>
	  <p>We may provide you with aggregated deal data to help you to make data-driven decisions when using our Products.<br>For example, we could indicate that <em>“90% of our users choose the YC-SAFE standard template for their first fundraising round”</em>. To provide such a service, we will need to be able to access anonymized and aggregated deal data across thousands of companies. You agree for specific data points from your company profile and settings to be included in such aggregated data services in non-identifiable and anonymised form, for the mutual benefit of all our users.</p>
	  <p>We think it’s pretty common sense but we’ll say it anyway:  if we, in our sole and absolute discretion, determine that you have acted inappropriately, we reserve the right to take down User Data, terminate your account, prohibit you from using the Products, and take legal action that we may deem fit.</p>
	  <p>When you use our Products or send communications to us through them, you are communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive electronically any communications related to your use of a Product. We may communicate with you by email or by posting notices on the Product. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that are provided to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. All notices from us intended for receipt by you shall be deemed delivered and effective when sent to the email address you provide to us. Please note that by submitting User Data, creating a user account or otherwise providing us with your email address, postal address or phone number, you are agreeing that we or our agents may contact you at that address or number in a manner consistent with our <a class="a-link" href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
	  <h4>Beta Products</h4>
	  <p>Occasionally, we release Products and/or Product features that are on a beta-basis -- such Products and/or features will be identified as “beta” or “pre-release”, or words or phrases importing similar meanings (each a “Beta Product”). Beta Products are not ready for prime time, and any warranties or contractual commitments that we may make for other Products do not apply.</p>
	  <h4>Send us any feedback you may have</h4>
	  <p>We welcome feedback. When you send us feedback or suggestions regarding us or any of our Products, there is a chance that we will use it. Please note that if you send us any feedback or suggestions, they will likely not be kept confidential. Along with any feedback or suggestions, you also grant us (for Legalese, and all of our users, customers, or any personnel of ours) an unlimited, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, sublicensable, transferable, royalty-free license to use any such feedback or suggestions for any purpose without any obligation or compensation to you. However, if we for whatever reason choose not to implement a suggestion or feedback, please know that we appreciate it nonetheless.</p>
	  <h4>Non-Legalese Stuff</h4>
	  <p>Our Products may from time to time include platforms that third parties may use to develop applications and software that complements the use of the Products, or content sourced from third parties that we have no relationship with, nor ownership or control over  (“<b>Non-Legalese Stuff</b>”). Non-Legalese Stuff are not our Products, and we do not warrant or support them. Ultimately, it is up to you (not us) that decides whether or not to use them or heed them.</p>

	  <h3>Ownership of Information & Proprietary Rights</h3>
	  <h4>What’s yours is yours</h4>
	  <p>As between us on one hand, and you and any Authorised Users on the other, you will retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in User Data, and all confidentiality rights in confidential company data.</p>
	  <p>Subject to these Terms, you (for yourself and all of your Authorised Users) grant us and the Extended Team, a worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, limited license to access, use, host, encode, store, reproduce, process, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations, or other changes we make so that your User Data works better with our Products), distribute, communicate, export, publish, publicly perform, and display User Data, and any Non-Legalese Stuff created by or for you, only as reasonably necessary (a) to provide, maintain, operate, promote, or improve the Products (or to develop new ones); (b) to prevent or address service, security, Product, support, or technical issues; and (c) as required by applicable law and/or regulations, or as permitted by the Data Request Policy. You represent and warrant to us that you have secured all rights in and to User Data from your Authorised Users as may be necessary to submit User Data and  grant this license. This license continues even if you stop using our Products, although some Products may offer you ways to access, remove, or limit the use of User Data that you had provided.</p>
	  <p>You also agree to indemnify, release, and hold us harmless from all liability, claims, actions, loss, harm, damage, injury, cost, or expense arising out of any User Data.</p>
	  <p>We may also employ automated systems to analyse your User Data to provide you personally relevant Product features.</p>
	  <h4>What’s others’ is others’</h4>
	  <p>Our Products may from time to time display content that is not ours. Such content remains theirs. For the avoidance of doubt, we make no representations, warranties, or endorsements as to the accuracy, completeness, relevance, or truth of such content. Accordingly, we cannot be held liable, directly or indirectly, for any loss or damage you suffer in connection with any such content that is not ours.</p>
	  <h4>What’s ours is ours</h4>
	  <p>Using our Products does not give you ownership or any proprietary or intellectual property rights in our Products or the content that you access. You may not use proprietary content from our Products unless you have obtained the requisite permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by applicable law to do so.</p>
	  <p>These Terms also do not grant you the right to use any branding  or logos used in our Products. You are also prohibited from removing, obscuring, or altering any notices or disclaimers displayed in or along with our Products.</p>
	  <p>We give you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Product(s). This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Product(s) as provided by Legalese, in the manner permitted by these Terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Product(s) or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our express written permission.</p>
	  <p>As an open source company, open source software is even more important to use. Some software used in our products may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly oveerride some of these Terms.</p>
	  <h4>Privacy and Copyright Protection</h4>
	  <p>Our <a class="a-link" href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Products. By using our Products, you agree that we can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.</p>
	  <p>We may choose to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement.</p>
	  <p>If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, please write to us at <a class="a-link" href="mailto:collective@legalese.com">collective@legalese.com</a>.</p>

	  <h3>Purchasing Decisions</h3>
	  <p>We may from time to time share information about our future products, plans, features, and functionalities (“<b>Possible Futures</b>”) because we relish the transparency and openness. However, please do not rely on our public statements about any Possible Futures when making a commitment or purchase with us. Should you decide to buy our Products or pay for any of them, that decision should be based on the functionalities or features that we have made available today and not on any expectation of delivery of any Possible Futures. Please take us as we are.</p>

	  <h3>Your Payment Obligations</h3>
	  <h4>Payment Terms</h4>
	  <p>If you purchase any of our Products or features, fees are specified in the check-out interface and must be paid in advance. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and, except as expressly stated by us in written terms, fees paid are non-refundable.</p>
	  <p>For clarity, in the event you downgrade any subscriptions from a paid plan to a free plan, you will remain responsible for any unpaid fees under the paid plan, and Products under the paid plan will be deemed fully performed and delivered upon expiration of the initial paid plan subscription term.</p>
	  <p>If we agree to invoice you by email, full payment must be received within thirty (30) days from the invoice date. Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “<b>Taxes</b>”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases, except for those taxes based on our net income.</p>
	  <h4>Credits</h4>
	  <p>Any credits that may accrue to your account (for example, from a promotion or given by us at our discretion), will expire following expiration or termination of the applicable credit as first made known to you, will have no currency or exchange value, and will not be transferable or refundable. Credits accrued to a team on a free subscription plan will expire if the team’s plan is not upgraded to a paid plan within one-hundred and eighty (180) days of accrual.</p>

	  <h3>Our Responsibilities</h3>
	  <h4>Providing the Services</h4>
	  <p>You’re not the  only one with responsibilities; we have some, too.<br>We will, subject to these Terms,  use our best efforts to (a) make the Product(s) available; and (b) not use or process User Data for any purpose without your prior written instructions; provided, however, that such prior written instructions include use of the Products  by Authorised Users and any processing related to such use or otherwise necessary for the performance of the Products.</p>
	  <p>Be assured that unless arising out of the <em>Non-Legalese Stuff</em> section, due to any breach of these Terms on your part, or circumstances not within our control,  we will not materially decrease the functionality of a Product during your applicable subscription term. For any breach of a warranty in this section, your exclusive remedies are those described in these Terms and your payments or subscription terms.</p>
	  <h4>Keeping the Products Available</h4>
	  <p>For some of our Products, we may offer specific uptime commitments paired with credits for the event if we fall short. In those cases, the credits will serve as what the lawyers call ‘liquidated damages’ and will be your sole remedy for the downtime and related inconvenience. For all Product plans, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to make them available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding planned downtime. We expect planned downtime to be infrequent but will endeavor to provide you with advance notice (e.g., through the Product(s)), if we think it may exceed five (5) continuous minutes.</p>
	  <h4>Protecting User Data</h4>
	  <p>The protection of User Data is a top priority for us so we will maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards at a level not materially less protective than as described in our <a class="a-link" href="security.html">Security Policy</a>. Those safeguards will include measures for preventing unauthorized access, use, modification, deletion and disclosure of User Data by our personnel. Before sharing User Data with any of our third party service providers, we will ensure that the third party maintains, at a minimum, reasonable data practices for maintaining the confidentiality and security of User Data and preventing unauthorized access.</p>
	  <p>However, you (not us) bears sole responsibility for adequate security, protection and backup of User Data when in your or your representatives’ or agents’ possession or control or when you choose to use unencrypted gateways (e.g., IRC/XMPP clients) to connect to the Products. We are not responsible for what your Authorised Users or Non-Legalese Stuff do with User Data. That is your responsibility.</p>

	  <h3>Modifying & Terminating Use</h3>
	  <p>We are constantly changing and improving. We may add or remove functionalities, features, or even Product(s) altogether. We may also stop providing Products to you, or add or create new limits to our Product(s) at any time. We also reserve the right to charge for any of our Product(s), features, or functionalities at any time.</p>
	  <p>You can stop using our Products at any time, although we’d be rather sorry to see you go.</p>

	  <h3>Our Warranties & Disclaimers</h3>
	  <p>We provide our Products using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t and cannot promise about our Products.</p>
	  <h4>We are not lawyers, legal, tax or financial advisers</h4>
	  <p>We provide information and access to industry standards, received industry advice, open-source, third party and proprietary documents and tutorials, templated forms, analytics and data, team administration and networking functionality, cap table modelling, and additional features to assist with the completion of tasks and workflows relating to your company and its administration.</p>
	  <p>You agree that you are solely responsible for the appropriate use of any documents, instructions, tutorials or data downloaded, obtained from or otherwise sourced in whole or in part from us or our Products. In particular you agree that:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>We are not providing legal, financial, tax, investment brokerage or any other advice. The Products  should not be used as a substitute for advice from qualified legal, tax or accounting professionals.</li>
	    <li>The documents available via the Products may not fit your specific circumstances. You should make your own judgement on the suitability of any such materials to your circumstances, or obtain your own legal advice to review such materials before using them.</li>
	    <li>We are not providing any assurance or guarantee that any documents provided via our Products are suitable, sufficient or appropriate for the use to which you put them.</li>
	    <li>We exclude all legal responsibility and costs for reliance placed by anyone on any documents obtained from us or our Products.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h4>No specific promises</h4>
	  <p>Save where expressly set out in these Terms or additional terms you have with us, neither Legalese nor its Extended Team make any specific promises about the Products or any part thereof. For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content within the Products, the specific function of the Product(s), or their reliability, enforceability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. The Products are provided on an as-is and as-available basis.</p>
	  <h4>No implied terms</h4>
	  <p>Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranties of merchantability, title, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.  You further acknowledge and accept that we do not warrant that the Products will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.</p>

	  <h3>Liability</h3>
	  <p>To the extent not prohibited by applicable law and/or regulations, Legalese and its Extended Team will not be responsible for any lost profits, revenues, investment, data, financial losses, opportunity costs, direct damages (i.e. damages that one would reasonable expect to arise from any breach in question, without taking into account any special circumstances of the non-breaching party), incidental damages (i.e. expenses incurred by the non-breaching party  in connection with its rejection of the Products, or by the non-breaching Party in connection with an  alleged breach), consequential damages (i.e. losses sustained by the non-breaching party that are attributable to any special circumstances of such party that the allegedly breaching party was aware of when the non-breaching party used the relevant Product(s)), exemplary or punitive damages.</p>
	  <p>Other than in connection with a party’s indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event will either Legalese or the Extended Team’s aggregate liability arising out of or related to the Terms  or any other applicable terms (whether in contract or tort or under any other theory of liability) exceed the total amount paid by you in respect of the relevant subscription and/or Product  in the twelve (12) months preceding the last event giving rise to liability. The foregoing will not limit your  payment obligations set out in these Terms or any other applicable terms.</p>
	  <p>You are responsible for all login credentials, including usernames and passwords, for administrator accounts as well the accounts of your Authorised Users. We will not be responsible for any damages, losses or liability to you, Authorised Users, or anyone else, if such information is not kept confidential by you or your Authorised Users, or if such information is correctly provided by an unauthorized third party logging into and accessing the services.</p>
	  <p>The limitations under this Liability section apply with respect to all legal theories, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, and to the extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Liability section allocate the risks between the parties under these Terms, and the parties have relied on these limitations in determining whether to enter into a contract for Products, subscriptions,  and the pricing for the Products (or any part thereof).</p>

	  <h3>Term & Termination</h3>
	  <h4>Contract Term</h4>
	  <p>A free subscription or use of the Product(s) continues until terminated, while a paid subscription or Product has a term that may expire or be terminated.</p>
	  <h4>Termination for Cause</h4>
	  <p>Either of us  may terminate these Terms on notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches the Terms and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after the non-breaching party provides notice of the breach.</p>
	  <p>You are fully responsible for your Authorised Users, including for any breaches of these Terms caused by your Authorized Users. We may terminate these Terms or any relationship with  you immediately on notice to you if we reasonably believe that the Products are being used by you or your Authorised Users in violation of applicable law.</p>
	  <h4>Effect of Termination</h4>
	  <p>Upon any termination for cause by you, we will refund you any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all subscriptions after the effective date of termination. Upon any termination for cause by us, you will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of those subscriptions after the effective date of termination. In no event will any termination relieve you of the obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.</p>
	  <h4>Data Portability and Deletion</h4>
	  <p>During your use of a Product or during the term of a subscription with us, you may be permitted to export or share certain UserData from the Products; provided, however, that because we have different products with varying features and you have different retention options, you acknowledge and agree that the ability to export or share User Data may be limited or unavailable depending on the type of Product plan in effect and the data retention, sharing or invite settings enabled. Following termination or expiration of your subscription, we will have no obligation to maintain or provide any User Data and may thereafter, unless legally prohibited, delete all User Data in our systems or otherwise in our possession or under our control.</p>

	  <h3>About these Terms</h3>
	  <h4>Force Majeure</h4>
	  <p>Neither of us will be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations on account of events beyond the reasonable control of a party, which may include denial-of-service attacks, a failure by a third party hosting provider or utility provider, strikes, shortages, riots, fires, acts of god, war, terrorism, and governmental action.</p>
	  <h4>Modifications</h4>
	  <p>We may modify these Terms or any additional terms that apply to the Products to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Products. You should look at these Terms regularly as we will post notice of modifications to these Terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Product(s). Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted, but where such changes address new functions for a Product or are made for legal reasons, such changes shall be effective immediately. If you do not agree to any modified terms, you should discontinue your use immediately.</p>
	  <h4>Governing Law</h4>
	  <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Singapore  without regard to the principles of conflict of laws. The parties hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Singapore.</p>
	  <h4>Precedence</h4>
	  <p>If there is a conflict between these Terms and the additional terms, the additional terms shall prevail to the extent that the conflict occurs.</p>
	  <h4>Severance</h4>
	  <p>If any provision of these Terms or part thereof is rendered void, illegal or unenforceable by any applicable laws and/or regulations to which it is subject, it shall be rendered void, illegal or unenforceable to that extent and no further.</p>
	  <h4>No third party beneficiaries</h4>
	  <p>These Terms control the relationship between Legalese and you, and do not create any third party beneficiary rights. The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap. 53B) of Singapore or any statutory equivalent  shall not under any circumstances apply to these Terms and any person who is not a party to these Terms (whether or not such person shall be named, referred to, or otherwise identified, or form part of a class of persons so named, referred to or identified, in these Terms) shall have no right whatsoever under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap. 53B) of Singapore to enforce these Terms or any of its provisions.</p>
	  <h4>Assignment</h4>
	  <p>Except with respect to the Extended Team, neither of us may assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld).</p>
	  <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing in this <em>Assignment</em> section, either of us may assign these Terms in its entirety, without consent of the other party, to a corporate affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. You will also keep your billing and contact information current at all times by notifying Legalese of any changes. Any purported assignment in violation of this section is void. A party’s sole remedy for any purported assignment by the other party in breach of this section will be, at the non-assigning party’s election, termination of these Terms upon written notice to the assigning party. In the event of such a termination by you, we will refund you any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all subscriptions after the effective date of termination. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>
	  <h4>Non-waiver</h4>
	  <p>If you do not comply with these Terms, and we don’t take action right away, this does not mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have, and this will not preclude us from taking any action in the future. Any single or partial exercise of any right under these Terms shall also not preclude any other or further exercise of it.</p>
