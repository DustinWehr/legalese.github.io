title: "An Investment Round"
excerpt: "templates for an angel or small seed round"
---
The v1 product assists with startup fundraising, for an angel or seed round. If you're raising Series A or later from a professional VC, they probably have their own paperwork and will manage the whole process. If you're raising a friends-and-family, angel, or seed round from a group of investors who don't do this stuff full-time, you're in the right place.

Click on "Seed Round".

Generate PDFs. This will generate a basic set of investment agreements.

You can change the pre-money valuation, the amount you're raising, and the type of the security.

The system knows about SAFE, 500's KISS, Series Seed, and other instruments.
