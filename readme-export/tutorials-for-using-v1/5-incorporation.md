You, a **power user**, configure the spreadsheets to create multiple agreements within a single document set.

1. Go to the `Incorporation` tab.
2. Generate PDFs.
    In a few minutes, you should see dummy documents for Frog Porridge Pte. Ltd., a company with three froggy founders and one wormy intern.
3. Look under the `Configuration` section. You'll see a line that says `Templates:`, followed by four templates named `jfdi_memorandum`, `form45`, `jfdi_shareholders_agreement`, and `jfdi_volunteer_agreement`. When you click `Generate PDFs`, those templates get filled.
    If you happen to actually be generating a Singapore company, put real particulars into the `Entities` tab.
4. You'll also need to put real particulars into the Roles section. You might need to have a heart-to-heart with your co-founders before you fill in `num_shares`.
