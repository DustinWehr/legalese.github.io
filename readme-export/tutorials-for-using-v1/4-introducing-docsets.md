title: "Introducing Docsets"
excerpt: ""
---
You, a **power user**, browse all the docsets that are available in Legalese. A docset generates one or more agreements. So far, all the docsets you've seen contain only one agreement.

1. Look at the row of tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet.
2. You will see tabs with names like `NDA`, `Entities`, `Incorporation`, `Class F`, `Seed Round` and `Cap Table`.
3. You can generate dummy agreements by going to each tab and clicking Generate PDFs. Each tab except `Entities` and `Cap Table`, that is.

## Entities
This tab is special. It contains the particulars of the parties to your agreements. It doesn't generate any agreements; other agreements refer to this.

Why? Because the names and addresses of your company, founders, employees, and investors are details used by multiple different agreements. The DRY principle says we should keep all that information in one place and not repeat it. So it lives in the **Entities** tab instead of repeating across multiple tabs.
