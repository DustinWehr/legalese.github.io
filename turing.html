		  <h1>Turing-Complete Contracts</h1>

		  <p>The Legalese team has started work on a JavaScript-to-English compiler. This is a research project. Software eats law in a specific way: it gets <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/turingd/">Turing'd</a>, by way of a domain-specific language. (Lawyers, don't worry; <a href="http://hodgen.com/questions-are-harder-than-answers/">you'll keep your jobs</a>.)</p>

		  <p>The goal? To enable a lawyer &ndash; better yet, a non-lawyer &ndash; to draft a contract more concisely and clearly than they could in a natural language, by writing what looks like computer code. The drafter gets to take advantage of all sorts of ideas from computer science: variables, functions, third-party libraries, syntax and type checking, unit testing, completeness, and consistency. And the drafting <em>community</em> can get ideas from software engineering, like collaborative version control and opensource community support practices. The contract can be tested by fuzzing against future scenarios of breach, possible legal challenges, and simulated courtrooms.</p>

		  <p>As Frederik Pohl might put it, <i>a good futurist predicts the car; a great futurist predicts the traffic jam</i>. If the car is a formal language for contracts and agreements (maybe even legislation), then a taxi service might be smart contracts integrated with cryptocurrencies and wholly automated business processes, exposed through legally binding APIs. The traffic jam? Maybe that's a DDOS in the form of micro-contract spam, a welter of frivolous lawsuits, or a zero-day exploit of an error enshrined in some old piece of paperwork that didn't get patched when the last novation service pack went around.</p>

		  <h2><a name="inspiration"></a>Where does the anger come from?</h2>

		  <p>Once upon a time, a programmer received an investment contract containing the following text, verbatim:</p>

		  <blockquote class="quotation smaller">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not more than S$32.5 Million, then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed valuation of S$27.5 million.</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation smaller">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at less than S$ 40 million but not below S$32.5 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a 15% discount over the valuation of the Series B Funding (for instance, if the series B Funding is at a valuation of S$35 million, then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert at a valuation of 35M less 15% discount);</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation smaller">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than S$ 40 million but less than S$47.06 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a 15% discount over the valuation of the Series B Funding (for instance, if the series B Funding is at a valuation of S$47.06 million, then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert at a pre-money valuation of 40M i.e. S$47.06 million less 15% discount);</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation smaller">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than S$ 47.06 million but less than S$80 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of S$40 million;</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation smaller">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than S$80 million but less than S$100 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of S$45 million; and</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation smaller">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than S$100 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of S$50 million.</blockquote>

		  <p style="margin-top:1.6em">Ten minutes and a strong cup of tea later, the notes in the margin read:</p>

<code style="white-space: pre-wrap">// why isn't this just
if      (seriesB < 32.5)  { conversion = 27.5 }
else if (seriesB < 40)    { conversion = seriesB * 0.85 }
else if (seriesB < 47.06) { conversion = seriesB * 0.85 } // then why the above line?
else if (seriesB < 80)    { conversion = 40 }
else if (seriesB < 100)   { conversion = 45 }
else                      { conversion = 50 }</code>

		  <p style="margin-top:1.6em">The next step is obvious: What if contracts could be written in a formal language first, and then compiled to natural language? A simple but powerful idea.</p>

		  <p>Imagine contracts in English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese &ndash; each translation provably identical to the others. Contracts amenable to formal methods: code verification can prove that a contract is internally consistent, free of contradiction, and complete. Contracts that execute themselves in software, integrated with business processes, interacting with other contracts. This vision has been expressed by <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/contractlanguage.html">Nick Szabo (2002)</a>, by <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2216866">Harry Surden (2012)</a>, by <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2538224">Flood &amp; Goodenough (2014)</a>, by <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5691">Camilleri, Paganelli, &amp; Schneider (2014)</a>, by <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-72952-5_11">Prisacariu &amp; Schneider (2007)</a>.</p>

		  <p>Implementing the vision is a <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/SMOP.html">simple matter of programming</a>!</p>

		  <h1>The Innovation</h1>

		  <p>Very clever people have thought long and hard about a world in which computers execute contracts, where programs transfer money to people and people transfer money to programs, where decentralized cryptocurrencies disrupt banks and financial institutions. Very clever people will be involved in the effort to build a bridge between formal and natural languages. Many man-years will go into developing a Github/Wikipedia of legal templates that are freely available for all to use.</p>

		  <p>Legalese is clever in a different way. The business challenge of getting from the 20th century status quo to the 21st century promised land requires the ability to scout and climb a monotonically increasing path through multidimensional "value-proposition" space toward the global optimax. This is as much a logistical and business challenge as a computational linguistics challenge. That's why we've chosen to start with spreadsheets: we optimize for the power user while building a painless onboarding pathway for first-timers.</p>

		  <p>You know how some extreme runners run fifty marathons in fifty consecutive days? Actually running the marathons is one kind of challenge. Arranging the flights, travel, and accommodation so the runner gets from finish line in one city to starting line in another, is different kind of challenge. Developing a domain-specific language, or a library in which to model contracts, is the former kind of challenge. Making Legalese succeed as a business is the latter kind.</p>

		  <h1>More Science Fiction</h1>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">Amber fast-forwards through the dynamic chunks of the README – boring legal UML diagrams, mostly – soaking up the gist of the plan. Yemen is one of the few countries to implement traditional Sunni shari'a law and a limited liability company scam at the same time. Owning slaves is legal – the fiction is that the owner has an option hedged on the indentured laborer's future output, with interest payments that grow faster than the unfortunate victim can pay them off – and companies are legal entities. If Amber sells herself into slavery to this company, she will become a slave and the company will be legally liable for her actions and upkeep. The rest of the legal instrument – about ninety percent of it, in fact – is a set of self-modifying corporate mechanisms coded in a variety of jurisdictions that permit Turing-complete company constitutions, and which act as an ownership shell for the slavery contract. At the far end of the corporate shell game is a trust fund of which Amber is the prime beneficiary and shareholder. When she reaches the age of majority, she'll acquire total control over all the companies in the network and can dissolve her slave contract; until then, the trust fund (which she essentially owns) oversees the company that owns her (and keeps it safe from hostile takeover bids). Oh, and the company network is primed by an extraordinary general meeting that instructed it to move the trust's assets to Paris immediately. A one-way airline ticket is enclosed.</blockquote>
