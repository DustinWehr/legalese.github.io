The v1 product assists with startup fundraising, for an angel or seed round. If you're raising Series A or later from a professional VC, they probably have their own paperwork and will manage the whole process. If you're raising a friends-and-family, angel, or seed round from a group of investors who don't do this stuff full-time, you're in the right place.

1. Click on "Seed Round".

2. Generate PDFs. This will generate a basic set of investment agreements.

3. You can change the pre-money valuation, the amount you're raising, and the type of the security.

4. The system knows about SAFE, 500's KISS, Series Seed, and other instruments.
