    (Say yes to "Make a copy?")
	
2. You should be in the Hello World tab. Some of the cells are bright yellow. We chose the same shade of yellow that you've seen in Word docs where you're expected to fill in the blanks.

3. Go ahead and fill in your particulars in the blank Row 14. If you leave it blank, we'll make something up for you. Change the email address for the _Acme Example_ company to be one of your email addresses.

4. What about the cells that aren't in yellow? You can look, but don't touch. Yet.

5. Create an agreement! Go to the navigation bar at the top of the spreadsheet. Click `Add-ons / Legalese / Generate PDFs`. Approve the authorization request.

6. A link should appear in cell E6 of the spreadsheet. It leads to an output folder in Google Drive.

7. In that folder, you should see an XML file. Yay! You are not expected to understand the XML. That's the job of the Legalese Robot.

8. Wait three minutes for the Legalese Robot to turn the XML into a PDF.
    (While you wait, you might check out the README file.)

9. If, after three minutes, a PDF doesn't appear, just reload the web page.
