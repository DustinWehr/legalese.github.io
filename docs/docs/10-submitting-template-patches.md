You, a **content developer**, learn how to fix bugs, develop tests, and submit patches for Legalese's XML template trove. How does Test-Driven Development work for contracts and legal documents?

Every advanced content developer moves in the direction of becoming a software developer; this is inevitable, and quite aligned with our premise; _software is eating law_. Here are some introductions to the art and craft of computer programming.

1. [The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.](http://www.grok2.com/progfun.html)

2. [Writing, Phaedrus](http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/482/482readings/phaedrus.html), has this strange quality, and is very like painting; for the creatures of painting stand like living beings, but if one asks them a question, they preserve a solemn silence. And so it is with written words; you might think they spoke as if they had intelligence, but if you question them, wishing to know about their sayings, they always say only one and the same thing. 
This was true for dumb writing, but computers have brought [interactive orality to traditional literacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_J._Ong#Orality_and_Literacy_.281982.29).

6. The differences between programmer, software engineer, architect, and language designer are about as vast as the differences between home cook, restaurant sous-chef, Wolfgang Puck, and Auguste Escoffier. These videos will be incomprehensible to the layman, but the breadth and depth of their sophistication should demonstrate to anyone that programming is equal to law, medicine, writing, or moviemaking: [Bret Victor, Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366) and [Simplicity Matters, by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0).
