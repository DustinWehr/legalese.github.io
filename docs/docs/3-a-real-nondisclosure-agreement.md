You, a **power user**, choose a real-world docset, and create a real-world agreement, taking advantage of the `INCLUDE` keyword to reuse the entities from a different tab.

1. Look at the row of tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet.

2. You will see tabs with names like `NDA`, `Entities`, `Incorporation`, `Class F`, and `Seed Round`.
Let's start with a simple agreement: a nondisclosure.

3. Go to the `NDA` tab.

4. Note that one of the section headings is `INCLUDE Hello World`. That tells Legalese to load the `Entities` data from the Hello World tab.

5. Generate PDFs and wait a couple minutes for the PDF to show up.

6. This time, you should see that the PDF is now a nondisclosure agreement.

7. There are two kinds of NDAs: unilateral and bilateral. Change cell B9 to suit, and generate again, if necessary.

8. If you actually want to send a real NDA, update the Entities in Hello Word with real particulars, then repeat the steps from [Tutorial 3](doc:tutorial-3-send-for-signature).
