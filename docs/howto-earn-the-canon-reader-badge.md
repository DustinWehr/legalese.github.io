A Canon Reader is someone who has read the set of documents known as the Legalese Canon.

Before you've finished the readings, you can still be a contributor to the project, but certain badges and roles require you to have fully achieved Canon Reader.

These books and blog articles help to site our project in a larger context â€“ historically, technologically, industrially, and commercially. These books take a long time to absorb. It may take you over a year to finish all the readings.
