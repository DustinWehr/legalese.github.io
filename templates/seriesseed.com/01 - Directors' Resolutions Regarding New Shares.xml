<definition_nonum>"seal"	means the common seal of the company;</definition_nonum>
<definition_nonum>"secretary"	means any person appointed to perform the duties of a secretary of the company;</definition_nonum>
<para_1>expressions referring to writing shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as including references to printing, lithography, photography and other modes of representing or reproducing words in a visible form;</para_1>
<para_1>words or expressions contained in these Regulations shall be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of the Interpretation Act (Cap. 1), and of the Act as in force at the date at which these Regulations become binding on the company.</para_1>
<b_left_sidehead_nonum>Share capital and variation of rights</b_left_sidehead_nonum>
<numbered_1_para>Without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any existing shares or class of shares but subject to the Act, shares in the company may be issued by the directors and any such shares may be issued with such preferred, deferred, or other special rights or such restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital, or otherwise, as the directors, subject to any ordinary resolution of the company, determine.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Subject to the Act, any preference shares may, with the sanction of an ordinary resolution, be issued on the terms that they are, or at the option of the company are liable, to be redeemed.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class) may, whether or not the company is being wound up, be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of 75% of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class. To every such separate general meeting the provisions of these Regulations relating to general meetings shall with the necessary modifications apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be 2 persons at least holding or representing by proxy one-third of the issued shares of the class and that any holder of shares of the class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. To every such special resolution section 184 shall with such adaptations as are necessary apply.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights shall, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking equally therewith.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The company may exercise the powers of paying commissions conferred by the Act, provided that the rate per cent or the amount of the commission paid or agreed to be paid shall be disclosed in the manner required by the Act and the commission shall not exceed the rate of 10% of the price at which the shares in respect whereof the same is paid are issued or an amount equal to 10% of that price (as the case may be). Such commission may be satisfied by the payment of cash or the allotment of fully or partly paid shares or partly in one way and partly in the other. The company may also on any issue of shares pay such brokerage as may be lawful.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Except as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the company as holding any share upon any trust, and the company shall not be bound by or be compelled in any way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any share or unit of a share or (except only as by these Regulations or by law otherwise provided) any other rights in respect of any share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Every person whose name is entered as a member in the register of members shall be entitled without payment to receive a certificate under the seal of the company in accordance with the Act but in respect of a share or shares held jointly by several persons the company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate, and delivery of a certificate for a share to one of several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders.</numbered_1_para>
<b_left_sidehead_nonum>Lien</b_left_sidehead_nonum>
<numbered_1_para>The company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully paid share) for all money (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a fixed time in respect of that share, and the company shall also have a first and paramount lien on all shares (other than fully paid shares) registered in the name of a single person for all money presently payable by him or his estate to the company; but the directors may at any time declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this regulation. The company's lien, if any, on a share shall extend to all dividends payable thereon.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The company may sell, in such manner as the directors think fit, any shares on which the company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, nor until the expiration of 14 days after a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable, has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the share, or the person entitled thereto by reason of his death or bankruptcy.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>To give effect to any such sale the directors may authorise some person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares comprised in any such transfer, and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The proceeds of the sale shall be received by the company and applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable, and the residue, if any, shall (subject to a like lien for sums not presently payable as existed upon the shares before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.</numbered_1_para>
<b_left_sidehead_nonum>Calls on shares</b_left_sidehead_nonum>
<numbered_1_para>The directors may from time to time make calls upon the members in respect of any money unpaid on their shares and not by the conditions of allotment thereof made payable at fixed times, provided that no call shall be payable at less than one month from the date fixed for the payment of the last preceding call, and each member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 days' notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his shares. A call may be revoked or postponed as the directors may determine.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the directors authorising the call was passed and may be required to be paid by instalments.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate not exceeding 8% per annum as the directors may determine, but the directors shall be at liberty to waive payment of that interest wholly or in part.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Any sum which by the terms of issue of a share becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed date shall for the purposes of these Regulations be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which by the terms of issue the same becomes payable, and in case of non-payment all the relevant provisions of these Regulations as to payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture, or otherwise shall apply as if the sum had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The directors may, on the issue of shares, differentiate between the holders as to the amount of calls to be paid and the times of payment.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The directors may, if they think fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same all or any part of the money uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him, and upon all or any part of the money so advanced may (until the same would, but for the advance, become payable) pay interest at such rate not exceeding (unless the company in general meeting shall otherwise direct) 8% per annum as may be agreed upon between the directors and the member paying the sum in advance.</numbered_1_para>

<numbered_2_para xname="permitted_transfer">The restrictions set out in this Article <xref to="transfer" /> shall not apply to any transfer of shares in the following circumstances:</numbered_2_para>
<numbered_3_para xname="permitted_transfer_reconstruction">by any Member being a corporation of any shares, to another corporation resulting from a reconstruction or amalgamation of such Member or to any subsidiary or holding company of such Member or to another subsidiary of such holding company;</numbered_3_para>

<numbered_2_para xname="rofr">Subject to any direction to the contrary that may be given by the company in general meeting, all shares, before being offered for transfer to any person who is not a Member, shall first be offered, on the same terms, to such persons as at the date of the offer are entitled to receive notices from the company of general meetings in proportion, as nearly as the circumstances admit, to the amount of the existing shares to which they are entitled, first within their class of shares and then to Members of other classes. The offer shall be made via the Directors or the Corporate Secretary by notice specifying the number of shares offered, and limiting a time within which the offer, if not accepted, will be deemed to be declined, and, after the expiration of that time, or on the receipt of an intimation from the person to whom the offer is made that he declines to accept the shares offered, the directors may register the transfer of those shares as directed by the transferor.</numbered_2_para>
<numbered_1_para>The instrument of transfer must be left for registration at the registered office of the company together with such fee, not exceeding $1 as the directors from time to time may require, accompanied by the certificate of the shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer, and thereupon the company shall subject to the powers vested in the directors by these Regulations register the transferee as a shareholder and retain the instrument of transfer.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The directors may decline to register any transfer of shares, not being fully paid shares to a person of whom they do not approve and may also decline to register any transfer of shares on which the company has a lien.</numbered_1_para>

<numbered_1_para>In case of the death of a member the survivor or survivors where the deceased was a joint holder, and the legal personal representatives of the deceased where he was a sole holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the company as having any title to his interest in the shares; but nothing herein contained shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by him with other persons.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member may, upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time properly be required by the directors and subject as hereinafter provided, elect either to be registered himself as holder of the share or to have some person nominated by him registered as the transferee thereof, but the directors shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in the case of a transfer of the share by that member before his death or bankruptcy.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or send to the company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he elects to have another person registered he shall testify his election by executing to that person a transfer of the share. All the limitations, restrictions, and provisions of these Regulations relating to the right to transfer and the registration of transfers of shares shall be applicable to any such notice or transfer as aforesaid as if the death or bankruptcy of the member had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by that member.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Where the registered holder of any share dies or becomes bankrupt his personal representative or the assignee of his estate, as the case may be, shall, upon the production of such evidence as may from time to time be properly required by the directors in that behalf, be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages, and to the same rights (whether in relation to meetings of the company, or to voting, or otherwise), as the registered holder would have been entitled to if he had not died or become bankrupt; and where 2 or more persons are jointly entitled to any share in consequence of the death of the registered holder they shall, for the purposes of these Regulations, be deemed to be joint holders of the share.</numbered_1_para>

<numbered_1_para>If a member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed for payment thereof, the directors may, at any time thereafter during such time as any part of the call or instalment remains unpaid serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of 14 days from the date of service of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and shall state that in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied with, any share in respect of which the notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the directors to that effect. Such forfeiture shall include all dividends declared in respect of the forfeited shares and not actually paid before the forfeiture.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>A forfeited share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the directors think fit, and at any time before a sale or disposition the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the directors think fit.</numbered_1_para>

<numbered_1_para>A statutory declaration in writing that the declarant is a director or the secretary of the company, and that a share in the company has been duly forfeited on a date stated in the declaration, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The company may receive the consideration, if any, given for a forfeited share on any sale or disposition thereof and may execute a transfer of the share in favour of the person to whom the share is sold or disposed of and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, or disposal of the share.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The provisions of these Regulations as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.</numbered_1_para>

<numbered_1_para>The holders of stock shall according to the amount of the stock held by them have the same rights, privileges and advantages as regards dividends voting at meetings of the company and other matters as if they held the shares from which the stock arose, but no such privilege or advantage (except participation in the dividends and profits of the company and in the assets on winding up) shall be conferred by any such aliquot part of stock which would not if existing in shares have conferred that privilege or advantage.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Such of the regulations of the company as are applicable to paid-up shares shall apply to stock, the words share and shareholder therein shall include stock and stockholder, and the terms "ordinary shares" and "common stock" shall be synonymous.</numbered_1_para>

<numbered_2_para_indent>cancel the number of shares which at the date of the passing of the resolution in that behalf have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person or which have been forfeited and diminish the amount of its share capital by the number of the shares so cancelled.</numbered_2_para_indent>
<numbered_1_para>The company may by special resolution reduce its share capital in any manner and with, and subject to, any incident authorised, and consent required by law.</numbered_1_para>

<b_left_sidehead xname="conversion">Conversion</b_left_sidehead>

<para_1>The holders of the Series Seed Preferred Stock have the following conversion rights (the <b><i>“Conversion Rights”</i></b>):</para_1>

<c_left_sidehead>Right to Convert</c_left_sidehead>

<numbered_4_firstbold_fltab xname="conversionratio">Conversion Ratio. Each share of Series Seed Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the series of Series Seed Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price for that series of Series Seed Preferred Stock in effect at the time of conversion.  The <b><i>"Conversion Price"</i></b> for each series of Series Seed Preferred Stock means the Original Issue Price for such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock, which initial Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, is subject to adjustment as provided in these Articles.</numbered_4_firstbold_fltab>

<numbered_4_firstbold_fltab>Termination of Conversion Rights.

<numbered_3_firstbold_fl xname="fractional">Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon conversion of the Series Seed Preferred Stock.  In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board.  Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion will be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.</numbered_3_firstbold_fl>

<c_left_sidehead>Mechanics of Conversion.</c_left_sidehead>

<numbered_4_firstbold_fltab xname="conversionnotice">Notice of Conversion. To voluntarily convert shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, a holder of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates for the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges that any such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company to indemnify the Company against any claim that may be made against the Company on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Series Seed Preferred Stock (or at the office of the secretary of the Company if the Company serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that the holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Series Seed Preferred Stock represented by the certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which the conversion is contingent (a <b><i>“Contingency Event”</i></b>).</numbered_4_firstbold_fltab>

<para_2_indented_66>The conversion notice must state the holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued.  If required by the Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing.
The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Company if the Company serves as its own transfer agent) of the certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice (or, if later, the date on which all Contingency Events have occurred) will be the time of conversion (the <b><i>“Conversion Time”</i></b>), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such time.
The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, (a) issue and deliver to the holder, or to the holder’s nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion in accordance with the provisions of these Articles and a certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate that were not converted into Common Stock, (b) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section <xref to="fractional" /> in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (c) pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock converted.</para_2_indented_66>

<numbered_4_firstbold_fltab>Effect of Conversion. All shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock that shall have been surrendered for conversion as provided in these Articles shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares will immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor, to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise issuable upon such conversion as provided in Section <xref to="fractional" />, and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.  Any shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued.</numbered_4_firstbold_fltab>

<numbered_4_firstbold_fltab>No Further Adjustment. Upon any conversion of shares of Pre-ferred Stock, no adjustment to the Conversion Price of the applicable series of Series Seed Preferred Stock will be made with respect to the converted shares for any declared but unpaid dividends on such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.</numbered_4_firstbold_fltab>

<numbered_3_firstbold_fl xname="stocksplits">Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Company at any time or from time to time after the date on which the first share of a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock is issued by the Company (such date referred to herein as the <b><i>“Original Issue Date”</i></b> for such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock) effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Series Seed Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of that series will be increased in proportion to the increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.  If the Company at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Series Seed Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the combination will be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.  Any adjustment under this Section <xref to="stocksplits" /> becomes effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.</numbered_3_firstbold_fl>
<numbered_3_firstbold_fl xname="adjustmentcertain">Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. If the Company at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock makes or issues, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price for such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the event will be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event a a record date has been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying such Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:</numbered_3_firstbold_fl>
<numbered_4_para_fltab>the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of the issuance or the close of business on the record date, and</numbered_4_para_fltab>
<numbered_4_para_fltab>the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the time of such issuance or the close of business on the record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution.</numbered_4_para_fltab>
<para_1>Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if such record date has have been fixed and the dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, such Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and there-after such Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section <xref to="adjustmentcertain" /> as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (ii) no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of the event.</para_1>
<numbered_3_firstbold_fl xname="adjustmentothers">Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If the Company at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall makes or issues, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Company (other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock), then and in each such event the Company shall make, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution to the holders of the series of Series Seed Preferred Stock in an amount equal to the amount of securities as the holders would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.</numbered_3_firstbold_fl>
<numbered_3_firstbold_fl xname="adjustmentmisc">Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock of the Company, whether by recapitalization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than by a stock split or combination, dividend, distribution, merger or consolidation covered by Sections <xref to="stocksplits" />, <xref to="adjustmentcertain" />, <xref to="adjustmentothers" /> or <xref to="adjustmentmerger" /> or by Section <xref to="liquidation" /> regarding a Deemed Liquidation Event), then in any such event each holder of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock may thereafter convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalisation, reclassification or change.</numbered_3_firstbold_fl>
<numbered_3_firstbold_fl>Adjustment for Merger or Consolidation. Subject to the provisions of Section <xref to="liquidation" />, if any consolidation or merger occurs involving the Company in which the Common Stock (but not a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash, or other property (other than a transaction covered by Sections <xref to="adjustmentcertain" />, <xref to="adjustmentothers" /> or <xref to="adjustmentmisc" />), then, following any such consolidation or merger, the Company shall provide that each share of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock will thereafter be convertible, in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible prior to the event, into the kind and amount of securities, cash, or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company issuable upon conversion of one share of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock immediately prior to the consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the transaction; and, in such case, the Company shall make appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board) in the application of the provisions in this Section <xref to="conversion" /> with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section <xref to="conversion" />(including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock.</numbered_3_firstbold_fl>
<numbered_3_firstbold_fl>Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price of a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section <xref to="conversion" />, the Company at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 15 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms of these Articles and furnish to each holder of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth the adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash, or other property into which such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.  The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of any series of Series Seed Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (a) the Conversion Price of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock then in effect and (b) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash, or property which then would be received upon the conversion of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock.</numbered_3_firstbold_fl>

Upon either (a) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock to the public in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an prospectus under the Securities and Futures Act or (b) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the Requisite Holders at the time of such vote or consent, voting as a single class on an as-converted basis (the time of such closing or the date and time specified or the time of the event specified in such vote or written consent,the <b><i>“Mandatory Conversion Time”</i></b>), (i) all outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares of Common Stock, at the applicable ratio described in Section <xref to="conversionratio" /> as the same may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with Section <xref to="conversion" /> and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Company.</numbered_3_firstbold_fl>
<numbered_3_firstbold_fl xname="procedural">Procedural Requirements.

<para_2>Unless otherwise provided in these Articles, the notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Time.
Upon receipt of the notice, each holder of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall surrender such holder’s certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company to indemnify the Company against any claim that may be made against the Company on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Company at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section <xref to="conversion" />.
If so required by the Company, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing.
