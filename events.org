* 2016-03-21 to 2016-03-25 Legalese Summit, Singapore
immediately following FOSSAsia -- see [[*2016-03-18 to 2016-03-20: FOSSAsia, Singapore][below]].

** Goals
Establish customer empathy for the early adopter segment -- the non-US founder of a tech startup raising funding or setting up an ESOP.

Plan out critical path toward business success:
- web app product development
- funding either public or private
- research project: expressive language required for efficient support for international jurisdictions
- opensource rollout for both the code and the legals
- marginally profitable revenue collection
- for scale, all human interactions to be referred out to legal or consultant partners

We will answer these questions:
- Who else is working in this domain?
- Why haven't they succeeded yet?
- How long will this take?
- What kind of organization do we need to build?
- What resources do we need to acquire?
- What deadlines?
- What conferences, if any, shall we attend?
- What core competitive advantage does the Legalese project have?

For each project participant, we evaluate:
- What level of commitment and contribution can we expect over the next 12 months?
- What level of compensation will be required to deliver that commitment?

** Format
Five days of afternoon sessions.

Each afternoon we hold two sessions.

Each session is two to three hours. Presentation, then discussion, then consensus.

* 2016-03-18 to 2016-03-20: FOSSAsia, Singapore
Meng will present Legalese in one of the conference sessions.

** Content
1. use of opensource in legalese. gripes about academic prior art not being opensource.
2. legalese itself being opensource, and comparisons to other infrastructure pieces like mysql/mariadb; the demographic of the opensource contributor as being both a user and a developer of the software, often as an adjunct to the day job
3. legalese being a facilitator of "smart contracts" and contracts generally that are themselves opensource â€“ blurring the line between creative commons and opensource content.
4. some amusing remarks questioning who owns the copyright in a contract
5. the situation with precedents is a lot like the state of software before opensource

the inspiring theme here, perhaps, is that humans are the only animal to use language as a tool. this interpretation of humanity elevates poets, lawyers, and programmers.

working backward from this agenda, what could the MVP for the purposes of fossasia look like? it could, very primitively, support the expression of a contract in our DSL, which converts to english and to ethereum. that expression of the contract should be opensourced, in a way that definitively addresses some of the unknowns highlighted in http://www.adamsdrafting.com/downloads/Copyright-NYLJ-8.23.06.pdf
