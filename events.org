** Content
1. use of opensource in legalese. gripes about academic prior art not being opensource.
2. legalese itself being opensource, and comparisons to other infrastructure pieces like mysql/mariadb; the demographic of the opensource contributor as being both a user and a developer of the software, often as an adjunct to the day job
3. legalese being a facilitator of "smart contracts" and contracts generally that are themselves opensource â€“ blurring the line between creative commons and opensource content.(edited)

the inspiring theme here, perhaps, is that humans are the only animal to use language as a tool. this interpretation of humanity elevates poets, lawyers, and programmers.

working backward from this agenda, what could the MVP for the purposes of fossasia look like? it could, very primitively, support the expression of a contract in our DSL, which converts to english and to ethereum. that expression of the contract should be opensourced, in a way that definitively addresses some of the unknowns highlighted in http://www.adamsdrafting.com/downloads/Copyright-NYLJ-8.23.06.pdf
