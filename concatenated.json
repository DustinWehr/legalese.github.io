The reason why the isomorphism principle is desirable is immediate: (local) changes in the paper contract correspond to (local) changes in the formalized contract (and vice versa), and a formal encoding which is reminiscent of the paper contract, should be easier for domain experts (i.e., lawyers) to maintain.",
